                    <p id="passage">In honor of the life of an incredible man, a devoted father of three, two of whom he embraced with unwavering love and patience as they navigated life with the gift of silence. 
                        Growing up on the east side of San Antonio, he faced challenges with resilience and grit, values that shaped him into the loving father and mentor he became. 
                        He was not only a father but also a cherished uncle, whose cheerful and kind-hearted spirit brought warmth to everyone around him. 
                        An avid sports fan, his passion for the Dallas Cowboys and admiration for Michael Jordan were more than hobbiesâ€”they were reflections of his enthusiasm for greatness and camaraderie. 
                        Through each step of his children's upbringings, he was present, offering guidance, laughter, and unconditional love. 
                        He taught us what it means to truly enjoy the little things, leaving a legacy of kindness and joy that will forever inspire those who knew him.
